        "     - Be sure to investigate the data in a way that allows you to discover all these surprises\n",
        " - Use [Chapter 5](https://mlbook.explained.ai/prep.html) of the textbook as a **guide**, except:\n",
        "     - you only need to use **random forest** models;\n",
        "     - exclude Section 5.5; \n",

        "     - error free\n",

        "         - this means that I don't want to see every piece of code you try as you work through this lab but only the final code; only the code that fulfills the objective\n",
        " - Use the **out-of-bag score** to evaluate models\n",
        "     - Read Section 5.2 carefully so that you use this method properly\n",
